A rule that disallows some unwanted symbols in percent array literals.

For example, this is usually written by mistake:

```
%i[:one, :two]
%w["one", "two"]
```

And the expected example is:

```
%i[one two]
%w[one two]
```

YAML configuration example:

```
Lint/PercentArrays:
  Enabled: true
  StringArrayUnwantedSymbols: ',"'
  SymbolArrayUnwantedSymbols: ',:'
```
